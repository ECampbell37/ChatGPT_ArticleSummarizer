      "As defined by Hoover (1999:8), hazing is “any activity expected of someone joining a group that humiliates, degrades, abuses or endangers, regardless of the person’s willingness to participate.” Ex-amples of typical hazing practices include: personal servitude; sleep deprivation and restrictions on personal hygiene; yelling, swearing, and insulting new members/rookies; being forced to wear embarrassing or humiliating attire in public; consumption of vile substances or smearing of such on one’s skin; brandings; physical beatings; binge drinking and drinking games; sexual simulation; sexual assault or death (Crow and Rosner 2002; Hoover 1999; Srabstein 2008).

Previously many acts of hazing were not prosecuted; it has only been in the last 10 years that more convictions for sexual assaults, assaults, forcible confinement, and manslaughter have resulted from hazing cases (Crow and MacIntosh 2009). Recent examples include: Anthony Clarke, a wide receiver for the Boise State football team and four others who were charged (December 2010) with forcible sexual penetration, battery, and false imprisonment of fellow athletes in Blackfoot, Idaho. Three former Carmel Indiana senior basket-ball players pled guilty in early January 2011 to assaulting two freshman players on a school bus as a part of their team hazing while returning from an away game (Nuwer, n.d.). a Comparative  analySiS  of CommunitaS  and riteS of paSSage      201\n",

      "1 The text discusses hazing rituals and ceremonies in various settings such as traditional cultures, schools, military, and sports. Student athletes often undergo hazing practices as a form of initiation for membership affiliation. Despite the abusive nature of hazing ceremonies in sports, there is still a demand for entry rituals to mark membership and identity within the team structure. The study compares contemporary initiations with historical traditions, highlighting the importance of establishing \"Rites of Passage\" for group membership. \n",
      "\n",
      "2 The section discusses the prevalence of hazing rituals and ceremonies in various cultures and institutions, including high schools, the military, private schools, and sports teams. Athletes often undergo hazing practices, with a high percentage reporting initiation into groups. The study compares contemporary initiations with historical traditions, highlighting the importance of rituals in establishing group membership. Despite the abusive nature of many hazing ceremonies, there is still a demand for initiation rituals to mark admission and identity within the team, although it can also negatively impact team relationships. \n",
      "\n",
      "3 The section discusses the definition of hazing as any activity that humiliates, degrades, abuses, or endangers individuals joining a group, regardless of their willingness to participate. It provides examples of hazing practices and mentions universities like Vermont and McGill canceling sports seasons due to hazing incidents. The text also highlights the implementation of anti-hazing policies and the criminalization of hazing in most states, with an increase in convictions for hazing-related offenses in recent years. Additionally, it touches on cultural rites of passage and the initiation of newcomers in sports teams through formalized hazing rituals. \n",
      "\n",
      "4 The text discusses the similarities between sport initiations and historical or cultural rites, focusing on the development of communitas, as defined by Victor Turner. It highlights the importance of entry rituals in maintaining community identity, cohesion, and belonging. The paper examines the function of ritual sports hazing and compares it to traditional rites of passage, arguing that true communitas is hindered by practices of humiliation and degradation in sport initiations. \n",
      "\n",
      "5 The section discusses the benefits of positive initiation ceremonies in sports and the potential for alternatives to traditional hazing practices, such as outdoor adventures. It highlights the differences in hazing laws and policies between Canada and the United States, with forty-four states in the US having antihazing laws. The section also points out the need for research on gender and hazing in sports, as sociologists have only recently started to explore the significance of hazing rituals for girls and women. \n",
      "\n",
      "6 The text discusses the gender differences in hazing activities, noting that hazing among men tends to be more violent while hazing among women is more psychological/emotional. However, recent cases have shown a shift in this trend, with girls and women also engaging in abusive hazing. The increase in girls and women participating in traditionally male sports has led to a rise in hazing incidents in women's sports. The continuation of harmful initiation practices is influenced by various factors such as alcohol, secrecy, hierarchy, gender, tradition, and masculinity. \n",
      "\n",
      "7 The text discusses initiation ceremonies, particularly in sports, as a way to forge strong bonds among members but also highlights the abusive nature of hazing rituals. It mentions that initiations can be traumatizing and discouraging for newcomers, with victims often downplaying their experiences. The text also touches on the hierarchical structure within groups and the reinforcement of masculinity through these rites of passage. Additionally, it notes the presence of misogyny and homoeroticism in hazing practices to enforce heterosexual identities. \n",
      "\n",
      "8 The text discusses transformative rites of passage found in various societies, often involving ceremonies that may seem barbaric and abusive in everyday life. These rituals are meant to mark the transition to full social membership. Arnold Van Gennep's work on initiation rituals, along with Victor Turner's three-phase model, provide a framework for understanding modern-day rites of passage, including those in sports and male socializing institutions. The central theme of most initiation rites is the change in identity, with the subject undergoing a transformation from an immature child to an adult through a process of destruction and resurrection. \n",
      "\n",
      "9 The text discusses Van Gennep's theory of the three phases of a rite of passage: separation, transition, and incorporation. During the separation phase, individuals experience a disconnection from their previous identity and may be given a new name symbolizing their new identity. This new name is often considered sacred and reserved for those who have undergone the initiation rite, such as in fraternities, the military, and sports. The changing of a person's name signifies a change in their true existence and marks their transition into a new phase of life. \n",
      "\n",
      "10 During the pre-initiation phase, rookies are separated from veterans and told exaggerated stories to create anxiety about the upcoming initiation phase. The liminal/transition phase, also known as the hazing phase, involves the symbolic death of the initiate's former identity and their entry into a transitional phase. During this time, novitiates undergo hazing and tests of fortitude to homogenize the group and emphasize their shared experience, fostering a sense of camaraderie and investment in each other. This phase is crucial in preparing the novitiates for their post-initiation identity and the culture they are entering. \n",
      "\n",
      "11 The section discusses the traditional cultural rites overseen by elders during the initiation phase, where neophytes are admitted into a social/cultural hierarchy. Academic studies have shown that coaches and alumni are active participants in sport initiation ceremonies. The Integration/Incorporation phase follows successful initiation, where new members are welcomed into the social group and cultural elements are transferred to them. This phase involves hazing, tests of fortitude, and other rituals that signal the values and hierarchy of the society, ultimately redefining the participants' existence. \n",
      "\n",
      "12 The text discusses the three phases of cultural and sport rites, which have been studied in various contexts such as police academies, military, youth subcultures, and athletic culture. These phases align with the concept of initiation outlined by Van Gennep. Some initiates undergo physical ordeals like circumcision or scarification as part of their rite of passage. The three phases are preinitiation anxiety, initiation/hazing experience, and temporary membership in a sport context. \n",
      "\n",
      "13 The text discusses various forms of hazing practices, including scarification, enduring tests of fortitude, and abuse, that are commonly used by sports teams, fraternities, and the military. Circumcision and subincision are highlighted as important parts of cultural rites of passage, serving as diplomas or marks of distinction. Pain and violence are often used in initiation rituals to create a sense of belonging and closer bonds among participants in organizations like the military, sport, police, and fraternal orders. These practices are based on a strict hierarchical structure within these groups. \n",
      "\n",
      "14 The section discusses how genital modifications, hazings, and other forms of abuse create vulnerability and dependence on the group for support. Initiation rites are seen as crucial for socialization and ensuring new members respect tradition. Durkheim's theory highlights the importance of rituals in fostering a sense of belonging and unity. Athletes often view initiation ceremonies as a team bonding experience that marks their transition into a group. \n",
      "\n",
      "15 The text discusses how initiation ceremonies help in forging new bonds and identities by facilitating a sense of belonging among athletes. It emphasizes the importance of athletes having an invested interest in pursuing membership and having their identity validated. The initiation process helps resolve the state of flux between identities for new initiates and also allows returning team members to express power and status over rookies. However, there is a danger that the cycle of violence or abuse can become attached to the ritual of belonging, making hazing seem necessary for team membership. \n",
      "\n",
      "16 The text discusses the importance of the separation between the profane and the sacred in rituals, emphasizing the effectiveness of rituals that take place outside of regular time and space criteria. In the context of varsity or university sports, initiation ceremonies serve as rites of passage for rookies transitioning from high school to university, symbolizing the move from outsider to insider in both sporting and academic realms. While bonds of membership in sports teams are transient compared to other life transitions, such as childhood to adulthood or singlehood to marriage, athletes on varsity squads may play for varying lengths of time, from one to five years. \n",
      "\n",
      "17 The text discusses the built-in lifespan of identities for varsity athletes, teams, and programs due to turnovers of players, coaches, and administrators. Unlike other group memberships, team membership is granted before initiations take place through try-outs and selection by coaches or senior team members. The text highlights that even skilled players will eventually have to retire from their team and sport, emphasizing the flexibility and differences in team membership compared to traditional cultural rites of passage. \n",
      "\n",
      "18 The text discusses how official membership on a sports team is determined before the initiation ceremony, which plays a significant role in forming and destroying identities, especially in sports. It highlights the interdependence between individuals and the group during this transitional experience. Victor Turner's concept of \"communitas\" is explained as an unstructured community where individuals submit to the authority of elders during rituals, breaking through structured norms. A study on hazing and perceived group cohesion showed that appropriate team building behaviors led to a more socially cohesive team, as expected. \n",
      "\n",
      "19 The text discusses how hazing activities in sports teams can actually lead to less team cohesion, contradicting the belief that hazing builds team unity. The research methodology used in the study involves qualitative research, which aims to provide in-depth and detailed descriptions of the participants' experiences. Participants were selected from teams that had previously initiated first-year players and were invited to a two-day orientation. \n",
      "\n",
      "20 The section discusses the orientations designed to introduce teams to nontraditional team building activities like rock climbing. Athletes and coaches were identified for potential interviews using mixed purposeful sampling. The researcher used purposive sampling to select varsity student-athletes or coaches with previous hazing experience, ensuring a balance of men and women and representation from various teams. Additionally, convenience sampling was included as participants were asked after the completion of the orientation event, with sixteen Canadian varsity athletes participating in the study. \n",
      "\n",
      "21 The section describes a study involving sixteen athletes and six coaches who participated in a weekend orientation in northern Ontario, Canada. The athletes were from various sports teams and ranged in age from 19 to 26, while the coaches were between 34 and 53 years old. Most participants were undergraduates, identified as \"white,\" and had at least two years of experience with their teams. Data was collected through qualitative one-on-one interviews after obtaining approval from the Human Subjects and Institutional Review Board. \n",
      "\n",
      "22 The text describes the methodology of conducting in-depth semi-structured interviews following Corbin and Strauss (2008). The interviews were guided to elicit systematic information from participants and explore various topics. Data from the interviews was transcribed, coded using open, axial, and selective coding, and compared to identify themes. This process allowed for a comparative analysis of community and rites of passage. \n",
      "\n",
      "23 The text discusses the use of \"hurricane thinking\" to analyze data and construct major themes with sub-sections related to the central theme. Multiple coding was used to reduce investigator bias and ensure qualitative inter reliability. Two experts in qualitative research were involved to ensure reliability, validity, triangulation, and consistency of the results. The section highlights the importance of hazing ritual expectations and the belief in the necessity of initiation for unifying a group. \n",
      "\n",
      "24 The text discusses how rites of passage, despite being sometimes seen as stupid or ugly, are crucial for new team members to go through in order to unite and differentiate themselves. Manny emphasizes the importance of a common ritual that all members must endure to define the team. While he acknowledges the necessity of humbling experiences for rookies, he believes there are alternative ways to achieve this goal. \n",
      "\n",
      "25 The section discusses the importance of humbling rookies in sports teams out of respect for veteran players. Dimitri believes that initiation ceremonies help establish team hierarchy and deflate egos of new players. Stella sees these ceremonies as a way to kickstart team potential and growth. It is crucial to blend the team together quickly to start performing well within a short period of time. \n",
      "\n",
      "26 The text discusses the ritual of hazing in varsity sports teams, where players come together, experience unity, and then focus on their individuality. This ritual is recognized and supported by the larger sporting community, not just the players. The absence of an entry ceremony can impact team dynamics, as illustrated by Matthew's feeling of not belonging due to lack of a welcoming ceremony. The education on hazing transcends levels within the team, from newcomers to coaches and administration. \n",
      "\n",
      "27 The section discusses the lack of formal introduction and team interaction, particularly among rookies who are expected to be held accountable for their actions. The author emphasizes that being a first-year player does not excuse them from responsibilities such as picking up equipment or cleaning the bus. Those who fail to fulfill their duties are reprimanded and told that such behavior is not acceptable. The author also mentions the challenge of enforcing consequences for non-compliance with team expectations. \n",
      "\n",
      "28 Ted and Sara both felt that the power dynamics within their team had shifted due to the discontinuation of the hazing ritual. Ted believed that reestablishing this ritual was necessary to redefine the hierarchy between rookies and veterans. Sara expressed that without an initiation, the team lacked unity and cohesion, leading to smaller subgroups forming within the larger group. This lack of initiation resulted in a cliquey atmosphere where team members did not socialize outside of playing together, ultimately affecting the sense of team spirit. \n",
      "\n",
      "29 The section discusses how athletes were interviewed about the initiation of first-year players, with some being told to \"tone it down\" or do nothing, leading to a sense of disjointedness within the group. The athletes recognized the risks and dangers of traditional hazing practices and how initiation ceremonies help maintain consensus in social/cultural orders. Threats of humiliation or ostracism ensure that these rituals are not challenged or exposed. \n",
      "\n",
      "30 The text discusses how the threat of ostracization through humiliation and degradation has historically been used to maintain compliance in initiation practices and order within communities. Novitiates often struggle to refuse brutal, dangerous, or illegal demands from veterans due to force and coercion. Compliance helps create solidarity and silence dissent within the community. The physical and psychological ordeals faced during the hazing stage are described as the \"sadistic side of the human imagination\" and have been seen in sport hazing events. \n",
      "\n",
      "31 The section describes instances of brutal hazing rituals experienced by a person named Manny during his rookie initiation in high school. These rituals involved humiliation, abuse of power, and fear tactics by the veterans. Manny now reflects on these experiences with horror and disgust, realizing the wrongness of his acquiescence to their demands. The hazing rituals served to establish a hierarchy where initiates were made to feel inferior to the veterans through fear and intimidation. \n",
      "\n",
      "32 The text discusses how senior members often exaggerate potential events to incoming recruits to emphasize the severity of initiation ceremonies. This exaggeration can actually provide relief to new members when they realize the ceremony is not as traumatic as described. Despite fears and pre-initiation anxiety from media and folklore, athletes still participate in hazing rituals. The narrator, while initially apprehensive, found the initiation experience to be less extreme than anticipated. \n",
      "\n",
      "33 The section discusses the discrepancy between the anticipation of initiation rituals and the actual experience, with some individuals expecting more intense hazing based on media accounts and cultural norms. It highlights how avoiding initiation in traditional contexts is not usually an option, but in sports, some may choose to opt out due to threats and folklore. The reaction to compliance with initiation rituals varies based on skill level, with highly skilled athletes facing fewer complications for refusing to participate. Overall, the section explores the impact of initiation ceremonies on team dynamics and individual experiences. \n",
      "\n",
      "34 The text discusses the dynamics of establishing superiority and hierarchy within sports teams, particularly between veteran players and rookies. It highlights the initiation rituals and hazing practices that are seen as a way to acculturate new members and create a sense of belonging. However, this behavior can lead to resentment and perpetuate a culture of subordination. The connection to a larger cultural tradition of hazing in athletic communities is also emphasized. \n",
      "\n",
      "35 The section discusses the concept of hazing within groups and how it perpetuates the status quo by creating a cycle of cultural transfer that allows problematic behaviors to persist unchecked. While the goal of initiations is to create community spirit and equality among members, modern hazing practices often involve power imbalances and abuse. The process aims to break down individuals to rebuild them according to the group's hierarchy, reinforcing the veterans' power over rookies both physically and mentally. \n",
      "\n",
      "36 The section discusses how previous studies suggested that severe initiations could strengthen bonds, but more recent research indicates that hazing can lead to mistrust of leadership. This mistrust is believed to stem from a clash of values in contemporary Western society. Failure to adopt new values can create resentment between initiates and initiators, disrupting the established hierarchy. Traditional forms of hazing may not foster trust due to the hostility and individual humiliation involved. The concept of communitas is often used to justify sport initiation ceremonies. \n",
      "\n",
      "37 The text discusses the importance of teammates' support and acceptance for athletes to fully enjoy their varsity experience. It emphasizes that without acceptance, players cannot be fully immersed in the team community, hindering the development of unity and equality. The text also highlights the need for successful initiation processes that educate new members and foster connections within the organization. Additionally, it mentions the importance of eradicating hierarchical structures and labels to ensure all members feel accepted and free from abuse and harassment. \n",
      "\n",
      "38 The section discusses how a more inclusive and supportive approach to initiation ceremonies in sports teams has replaced traditional hazing practices. The event highlighted the importance of veterans and rookies supporting each other, rather than hoping for failure. Respondents noted the effectiveness of the orientation ceremony in creating a welcoming and bonding space, while also acknowledging its limitations in fully replacing traditional hazing practices. Overall, the orientation ceremony was seen as a more positive and effective way to integrate new members into the team without negative feelings towards veteran players. \n",
      "\n",
      "39 The text discusses the difference between hazing practices and Orientation Camp for new team members. Dimitri highlights the positive environment and lack of coercion at Orientation Camp, leading to stronger bonds without negative effects. Andrew emphasizes the potential dangers of traditional hazing rituals, which can lead to negative feelings and animosity. Both players agree on the importance of establishing strong bonds through initiation experiences. \n",
      "\n",
      "40 The text discusses how traditional forms of hazing in sports teams can lead to tension and resentment between veteran players and rookies. It highlights how mistreatment of rookies can create a divide within the team, with first-year players forming a stronger bond among themselves. The text emphasizes the importance of orientation programs that promote unity among all team members, shifting away from hazing rituals rooted in degradation and mistrust. This cultural shift aims to create a more inclusive and supportive team environment. \n",
      "\n",
      "41 The text discusses the value of initiation ceremonies for athletes and suggests that an alternative approach can be more effective in fostering camaraderie among team members. By replacing brutal initiation rituals with a more neutralizing and friendly orientation, the cycle of degradation and pain can be broken. The comparison between traditional coercion-based initiation and a more respectful approach highlights the importance of trust and camaraderie in team dynamics. Ultimately, the text emphasizes the potential for a more positive and inclusive initiation process for new team members. \n",
      "\n",
      "42 The text discusses the contrasting views on hazing within athletic teams, with some arguing that traditional forms of hazing do not establish trust and can lead to hostility and grudges. It is suggested that removing negative aspects of hazing may not benefit the team, but severe initiation can harm team integrity. The text also highlights the negative effects of hazing, describing it as dysfunctional, violent, and traumatizing. \n",
      "\n",
      "43 The section discusses the importance of initiation in organizations to help new members feel a sense of belonging and integrate into the group. It highlights how initiation ceremonies personalize individuals and showcase their value within the team, ultimately strengthening the bond between new and established members. The text also emphasizes how initiation rituals serve as a transitional experience for new members, symbolizing their shift from being outsiders to fully integrated members of the organization. Overall, the section underscores the significance of initiation in maintaining the organization's culture and ensuring continuity through new members. \n",
      "\n",
      "44 The text discusses the differences between contemporary and cultural rites of passage, particularly focusing on how modern ceremonies have incorporated humiliation and degradation. It highlights how hazing rituals in some subcultures impose excessive demands on new members, leading to conformity but also causing fractures within the group. The initiation ceremony in sports is also mentioned as a way for identity formation and community bonding among team members of all levels. \n",
      "\n",
      "45 The section discusses how junior players in a team are now responsible for creating and carrying out initiation rituals for new members, marking a transition to a veteran role. This process allows senior members to establish their leadership and status within the team hierarchy. Initiation activities, including hazing, are seen as a way to build unity and cohesion within the group, despite controversial practices like beatings or public nudity. Overall, the initiation process aims to foster a sense of togetherness and belonging among team members. \n",
      "\n",
      "46 The section discusses the concept of initiation and hazing within groups, highlighting how these experiences can create a sense of commonality among participants. However, it also emphasizes the negative impact of abusive hazing practices, which can lead to long-term consequences and erode team relationships. While communitas, or group unity, is the desired outcome of modern and cultural initiations, some rituals continue to rely on abusive and degrading traditions that hinder true development of communitas. Modern rituals have shifted towards actively incorporating degradation as a key component, deviating from traditional practices where degradation was a consequence of noncompliance. \n",
      "\n",
      "47 The text discusses how degrading hazing practices in sports can actually create division among group members, despite the belief that hazing brings people together. These activities lead to compliance and maintain cultural order by discouraging sharing of humiliating experiences. Modern initiations involving humiliation and abuse result in resentment, division, and mistrust, restricting initiates' abilities to act independently. Overall, hazing is shown to be exclusive, inequitable, destabilizing, and abusive, contrasting with the idea of communitas. \n",
      "\n",
      "48 The section discusses the initiation ceremony in a sporting context, highlighting how it plays a role in identity formation for both new initiates and established team members. It explains how junior players transition into veteran roles through the responsibility of organizing the initiation ritual, allowing them to establish themselves as team leaders. The initiation also serves as a way for senior members to assert their power and status over rookies, potentially leading to the expression of past grievances or feelings of dominance. Overall, the initiation process is a transformative opportunity for team members to solidify their roles within the team hierarchy. \n",
      "\n",
      "49 The text discusses how cohesion and community can be achieved through alternative orientations in sports teams, leading to a change in the nature of rookie parties. Initiates were no longer pressured or humiliated during these events, as athletes saw them as individuals rather than just rookies. This shift towards inclusion and true community contrasts with contemporary sport team initiations that focus on humiliation. The unifying principle of these ceremonies is questioned, as they often revolve around abuse and the promise of power and status. \n",
      "\n",
      "50 The section discusses the importance of successful initiations in achieving unity within a group by educating new members, fostering connections, and creating a sense of commonality. Initiations such as preseason training, maintaining a specific grade point average, and participating in team activities like community service or skit nights can help in developing this unity. The text also references a study on hazing among college students by Allan and Madden, highlighting the risks associated with certain initiation practices. \n",
      "\n",

Nuwer called \"The Hazing Reader\" which examines hazing in various settings such as fraternities, athletics, high schools, and the military. Additionally, it mentions a study by Aronson and Mills from 1959 that looked at how the severity of initiation impacts one's liking for a group. \n",
      "\n",
      "52 The section mentions references to two studies: one by Baumeister and Leary in 1995 on the desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation, and another by Beccaria and Sande. Baumeister and Leary's study explores the need to belong as a key human motivation, while Beccaria and Sande's study is not further elaborated upon in the summary. These studies likely delve into the psychological aspects of human relationships and the importance of social connections. \n",
      "\n",
      "53 The section discusses a comparison of the meaning and functions of young people's use of alcohol during the transition to adulthood in Italy and Norway. It also mentions a study on hazing in sports, specifically looking at veteran/rookie relationships.
